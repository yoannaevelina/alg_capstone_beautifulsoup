### The Final Result

Japanese Yen hit the rock botton at the end of 2019 first quarter before skyrocketing in the next 2 quarters. This followed Japan's declining export level. Furthermore, there was a speculation of investor's risk appetite escalating, which was not in favor of JPY as safe haven.
